# Encryption Project

This project demonstrates how to generate RSA keys, encrypt, and decrypt files using Python.

## Files

- `generate_keys.py`: Generates and saves the private and public keys.
- `encrypt_file.py`: Encrypts a file using the public key.
- `decrypt_file.py`: Decrypts a file using the private key.

## Usage

1. Run `generate_keys.py` to generate the keys.
2. Place the file to be encrypted as `original_file.txt` and run `encrypt_file.py`.
3. Run `decrypt_file.py` to decrypt the file back to `decrypted_file.txt`.
